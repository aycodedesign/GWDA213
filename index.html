		<h1>My Biggest Childhood Regret</h1>
		<p>
			By all accounts, I had a pretty decent childhood. I was fortunate to have everything I needed, and many of the things I wanted. But the one thing that eluded me as a child was getting my very own Aggro-Crag trophy from the Nickelodeon show, Guts. If you're
			unfamiliar with the show, imaging American Ninja Challenge for kids. Below recounts me going through the 5 Stages of Grief over the Aggro-Crag trophy.

			<h3>Denial</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>
					"D-D-D-Do You Have It?! Guts!"<br><br> I did. I knew I did. I was 10 years old and a pretty active kid. I would watch Guts and KNEW I could do just as good and possibly even better than most of the kids on the show. In my mind, it was ridiculous that my parents couldn't drive down to Universal Studios in Orlando, be a walk-on contestant on "Guts" and take home the coveted Aggro-Crag Trophy.

			<h3>Anger</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>
					Yep, Anger. Was I angry that I probably would never get my hands on an Aggro-Crag Trophy? I sure was.
				</strong>
			</p>
			<p>

			<p>
				<strong>
					Look at it! It's glorious. I'm sure my parents thought I was just a kid wanting a piece of this shiny plastic object, but everytime I watched a subpar contestant climb the Aggro-Crag and win a trophy, the anger brewed.
				</strong>
			</p>
		</section>

		<section id="sect3">
			<h3>Bargaining</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>
					Bargaining was a strong part of my argument to appear on Guts. My grandparents lived in Miami, and Orlando was just a couple hours north of them. Since we normally went to Disney World when visiting my grandparents, I figured a QUICK pitstop to Nickelodeon Studios would for sure warrant my walk-on and subsequent victory on "GUTS".

			<h3>Depression</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>
					This section is definitely not to make fun of actual depression. Like I said in the beginning, I had a solid childhood by all accounts; but 10 year old me knew that never having been on "GUTS" would probably be my haunting memory for the rest of my life. Yes I had plenty of trophies from other sports and accomplishments, but none of them were the glowing piece of the Aggro-Crag.<br><br>Fortunately, as I grew up and other activities took up my brainspace, I eventually forgot about wanting a GUTS Trophy. But every now and then, the fantasies would come back of me standing on the winner's platform, trophy held high above my head.
				</strong>
			</p>

		<section id="sect5">
			<h3>Acceptance</h3>
			<img src="./img/aggro-crag.jpg">
			<p>
				<strong>
					Though I would never get to climb the Aggro-Crag, I eventually accepted that the ultimate kids challenge just wasn't in the cards for me. But, I still had the memories of watching "GUTS" with my brother and cheering or jeering the competitors.<br><br>
					Then I found out a past winner sold his Aggro-Crag for $1500 on eBay a few years ago for $1500.00. <br><br>
					If another one comes up for sale in the next few months, and if anyone is interested, my birthday is in April. HMU for shipping details.
